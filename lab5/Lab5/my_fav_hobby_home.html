		<h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My favorite hobby has been the same for most of my life. I have loved the game of basketball since I was little. It has always served as a place I could go to clear my head and get away from things that were bothering me. I ran with that and a young age and it has become my life.</p>

		<p>Basketball has also given me a chance to meet some of my best friends in my life along with some very influential people in my life.</p>

        <p>Additionally, it has given my family some life long memories. My parents and I have only grown closer through numerous shared experinces and many long trips and car rides to here, there and everywhere together.</p>
