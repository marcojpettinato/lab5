		<h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Once I left high school to play basketball in college things became increasingly difficult. The biggest change is the time management and things that are asked of you as a college athlete. Ones my priorities are challenge day in and day out. You are asked to ballance things like:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Basketball</li>
            <br>
            <li>School</li>
            <br>
            <li>Family</li>
            <br>
            <li>Friends</li>
            <br>
        </ol>

        <p>After some time I learned how to balance these things and being a college athlete became one of the most fullfilling and funs things I have ever done in my life.</p>
